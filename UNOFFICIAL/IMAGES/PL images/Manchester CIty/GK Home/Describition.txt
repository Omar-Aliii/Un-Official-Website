From 1967 to 1971, no team could match the style and swagger of Manchester City.â€¯Their pass-and-move, end-to-end attacking football was simply ahead of its time. This season, we honour this team of entertainers and their leader: club icon Colin Bell. The Manchester City 2022/23 goalkeeper kit echoes the classic designs from their era.
