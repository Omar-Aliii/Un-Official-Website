                    Football is Culture. Our 2022/23 Home kit features the retro jersey elements from the era of Colin
                    Bell, executed in a sophisticated modern silhouette. The club crest is back in the centre, as are
                    burgundy trims on the sleeve cuffs, shorts and socks. The crown logo inside the neckline pays
                    tribute to "Colin the King". With this Man City Home jersey we bring all generations of fans
                    together.
