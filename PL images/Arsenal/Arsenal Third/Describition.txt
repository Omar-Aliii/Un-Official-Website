Arsenal DNA gets reimagined for the modern fan in the Arsenal 22/23 Third Shirt. Inspired by the Club’s late 20th century crest, this fan’s version Arsenal third shirt features an all-over ermine print, a delicate pink finish, and a classic regular fit for a fresh take on classic sportswear. Embedded in the fabric, adidas moisture-absorbing AEROREADY technology ensures you are always dry and confident, while mesh underarm panels bring everyday comfort to the next league.  

This shirt is made with Primegreen, a high-performance material obtained from recycled polyester, without the use of virgin plastic.

Make it your own by having your chosen name and number printed on the back. Your shirt, your way.
