No matter what life throws at you, the Arsenal 22/23 Goalkeeper Shirt has got your back. Both visually and technically striking, it comes with an embroidered Club crest at chest, movement-enhancing stretch panels, and side slits with a droptail hem for the ultimate on-pitch performance. Embedded in the fabric, adidas moisture-absorbing AEROREADY technology ensures you stay dry and confident, on the pitch, on the terraces, and everywhere else in between.

This goalkeeper shirt is made with Primegreen, a high-performance material obtained from recycled polyester, without the use of virgin plastic.

Make it your own by having your chosen name and number printed on the back. Your shirt, your way.
