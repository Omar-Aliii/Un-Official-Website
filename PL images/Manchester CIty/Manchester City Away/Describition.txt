City put on a show. When the class of 1969 took to the road, they turned heads with their fearless, technically adept football – and their bold and brilliant new away strip. Conceived by the legendary Malcolm Allison, vertical stripes of red and black proved triumphant at the 1969 FA Cup Final, and the 1970 League Cup and European Cup Winners’ Cup finals, earning their place among all-time fan favourites. Details include the PUMA Cat logo and Manchester City club crest on the chest.
