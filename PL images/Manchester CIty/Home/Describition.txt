Football is Culture. Our 2022/23 Home kit features the retro jersey elements from the era of Colin Bell, executed in a sophisticated modern silhouette. The club crest is back in the centre, as are burgundy trims on the sleeve cuffs, shorts and socks. The crown logo inside the neckline pays tribute to "Colin the King". With this Man City Home jersey we bring all generations of fans together.
